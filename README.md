# Space-Shooter
Project 2 for MSCH-C220

9/27/23

A simple and fun 2D space shooter game.

## Implementation
The game was made in Godot 4 and was saved and exported to github

## What Makes this a Game?
This is a game because the player has an objective to kill all of the enemies in a certain amount of time with limited ammo. The player has a choice to either get more ammo by picking up the purple plus sign, or they can choose not to as well. The player has the choice to either fly around the screen or stay in one place as they shoot the enemies.
